# todo now, 
read up on the folders... because i must understand with the app1/app2 vmss... and how they relate to what i'm doing. start with doing the re-read on the load-balancer, go through the code, understand it, then go forward until i know my path...

fix with vms (vmss, actually)

from comment way earlier

at the end, make sure to use concepts like

instead of using the database config, use some ansible config instead for the vmss. or docker?
