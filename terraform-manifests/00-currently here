# todo now, 
proceed via first making sure my null resource is a basitian host
this bastian host should be the only vm to ssh into my web and app vm(ss)


now, make so the web vm hosts the static website
and the app vm hosts the cv, by storing and displaying it from the azure storage account (not from local computer)

this also means that the current file provisioner from the null resource should only send the ssh key, and also with appropriate permissions
  (and not the resum√©)

at the end, make sure to use concepts like

instead of using the database config, use some ansible config instead for the vmss. or docker?
