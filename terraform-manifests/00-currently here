# todo now, 

possibly, the case is i only need one vmss, one load balancer
and one jump off box (with own ip)

then i just need to make sure it works as intended.

for this, first describe what i want to make happen
then past my current (relevant) code

then ask gpt to make changes accordingly

(also, possibly, check why it's the case i cannot current ssh into the web vm, but only to the jump box)

at the end, make sure to use concepts like

instead of using the database config, use some ansible config instead for the vmss. or docker?
