# todo now, 

how do i ssh into the vm? it has no public ip? using bastion somehow
the reason i want to ssh into the linux web vm is to check if the cv is deployed there...
  but possibly it should be deployed on the backend linux vm

now, the question is, what is the relationship between hosting the static website and linking to the cv?
  linux web vm hosts the static website
  linux backend hosts the cv
   



-----------
my goal now is that one vmss serves the static website and the resum√©

depending on where the user goes, either to the root
or to the /resume path, the application gateway will direct the traffic to the appropriate backend pool



follow:

for the webvm_custom_data, make sure i do not disable the firewall completely... instead, make sure i can only access the vm through the basion (and then include the ip of the bastion). 
this is done in the nsg for web
  
/
locals {
ssh_source_address = "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32" # Replace with your IP address for SSH access
}

  source_address_prefix       = local.ssh_source_address
/

also, actually have the cv in local file but use "azurerm_storage_container" to upload it... see c10 in #20 on local terraform-on-azure-cloud on windows drive
