# todo now, 

following this tutorial https://www.udemy.com/course/terraform-on-azure-with-iac-azure-devops-sre-real-world-25-demos/learn/lecture/28187274#overview
and create a storage for custom-error-pages.

also, add my pdf to this code, too
-----------



----------
rename "web linuxvm" or "static website" to "frontend", to conform to naming standard, do it all over... like also in ag

in ag, fix so locals are used more consistently



note: i have already created a repo for creating vmss setup but this is overkill. better to learn azure devops and applying to jobs
enable vmss autoscaling for web and backend linux vm
