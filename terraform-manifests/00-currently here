# todo now, 

----------
rename "web linuxvm" or "static website" to "frontend", to conform to naming standard, do it all over... like also in ag
---------
in ag, fix so locals are used more consistently
----------
fix error messages, so 404 etc exist, and 502 etc works
----------

note: i have already created a repo for creating vmss setup but this is overkill. better to learn azure devops and applying to jobs
enable vmss autoscaling for web and backend linux vm

----------
