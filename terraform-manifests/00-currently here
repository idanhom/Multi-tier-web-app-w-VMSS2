# todo now, 



-----------
my goal now is that one vmss serves the static website and the resumé

depending on where the user goes, either to the root
or to the /resume path, the application gateway will direct the traffic to the appropriate backend pool

follow: 
C:\Users\pson9\Documents\github\terraform-on-azure-cloud\28-Azure-Application-Gateway-Path-Based-Routing
-------------


for the webvm_custom_data, make sure i do not disable the firewall completely... instead, make sure i can only access the vm through the basion (and then include the ip of the bastion). 
this is done in the nsg for web
  
-------------


make sure i host the resumé in the container as code, using "azurerm_storage_container" to upload it... see c10 in #20 on local terraform-on-azure-cloud on windows drive
C:\Users\pson9\Documents\github\terraform-on-azure-cloud\20-Azure-External-and-Internal-LB-with-VMSS

----------

enable vmss autoscaling for web and backend linux vm

----------

create self-hosted ssh (there is tutorial in 30 or 31 of terraform-on-azure-cloud guide)
