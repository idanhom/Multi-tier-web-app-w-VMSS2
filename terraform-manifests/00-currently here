# todo now, 
before going on with my modifications, currently when i deploy my bastion i get this error:
│ Error: file provisioner error
│ 
│   with null_resource.copy_ssh_to_vm,
│   on 08-02-null-resource.tf line 13, in resource "null_resource" "copy_ssh_to_vm":
│   13:   provisioner "file" {
│ 
│ timeout - last error: dial tcp 10.0.1.4:22: i/o timeout

troubleshoot this before continuing


after that is done, proceed with the rest:
-----------
my goal now is that one vmss serves the static website and the resumé

depending on where the user goes, either to the root
or to the /resume path, the application gateway will direct the traffic to the appropriate backend pool



follow: 
C:\Users\pson9\Documents\github\terraform-on-azure-cloud\28-Azure-Application-Gateway-Path-Based-Routing



for the webvm_custom_data, make sure i do not disable the firewall completely... instead, make sure i can only access the vm through the basion (and then include the ip of the bastion). 
this is done in the nsg for web
  
/
locals {
ssh_source_address = "YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/32" # Replace with your IP address for SSH access
}

  source_address_prefix       = local.ssh_source_address
/

also, actually have the cv in local file but use "azurerm_storage_container" to upload it... see c10 in #20 on local terraform-on-azure-cloud on windows drive
