# todo now, 

i want to make so when i go to the web vm, it shows the website's static content
  here, i should also be able to download the resum√©.
  for this, i need to make changes to path based routing, so depending on what i choose to do, it direct make sure there is not overload on website (no buffer)
    load balancer, 

however i want to make so that i'm using the path based routing, using application gateway, 
so on the static website, there should be a link to the cv which can be downloaded (using application gateway)


follow: 
C:\Users\pson9\Documents\github\terraform-on-azure-cloud\28-Azure-Application-Gateway-Path-Based-Routing


---
doing the above means to remove app subnet, for example...





also, actually have the cv in local file but use "azurerm_storage_container" to upload it... see c10 in #20 on local terraform-on-azure-cloud on windows drive
C:\Users\pson9\Documents\github\terraform-on-azure-cloud\20-Azure-External-and-Internal-LB-with-VMSS
