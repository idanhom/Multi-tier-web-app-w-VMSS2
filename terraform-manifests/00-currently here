# todo now, 


create self-hosted ssh (there is tutorial in 30 or 31 of terraform-on-azure-cloud guide), then also use https in application gateway

-----------


make sure i host the resum√© in the container as code, using "azurerm_storage_container" to upload it... see c10 in #20 on local terraform-on-azure-cloud on windows drive
C:\Users\pson9\Documents\github\terraform-on-azure-cloud\20-Azure-External-and-Internal-LB-with-VMSS

----------
rename "web linuxvm" or "static website" to "frontend", to conform to naming standard




note: i have already created a repo for creating vmss setup but this is overkill. better to learn azure devops and applying to jobs
enable vmss autoscaling for web and backend linux vm
