# todo now, 

i want to make so when i go to the web vm, it shows the website's static content
when i instead go to the app ip, i can download the cv.

however i want to make so that i'm using the path based routing using load balancer config.
  in the static website, there should be a link to the cv which can be downloaded (and directed using the load balancer)



for this, i need to follow this guide:
https://github.com/stacksimplify/terraform-on-azure-cloud/tree/main/28-Azure-Application-Gateway-Path-Based-Routing


to use (and modify), load balancer (path based), vmss (for web and app linux), natGW


here, note, also to use vmss, and natGW (which i currently don't understand how it works)
