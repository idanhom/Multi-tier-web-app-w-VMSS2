# todo now, 

my goal now is that the vm serves the static website
and another path from the vm hosts the resume

depending on where the user goes, either to the root
or to the /resume path, the application gateway will direct the traffic to the appropriate backend pool



follow:

also, actually have the cv in local file but use "azurerm_storage_container" to upload it... see c10 in #20 on local terraform-on-azure-cloud on windows drive
