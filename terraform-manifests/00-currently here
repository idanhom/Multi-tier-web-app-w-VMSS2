# todo now, 
i have now successfully deployed the website. i'm using a jump off box. however i cannot download the resum√©.
currently troubleshooting this. 

when trying to ssh into my web vm, i get this error: "ssh: connect to host 52.178.164.204 port 22: Connection refused"

possibly, the reason for this is that the web vm is using a load balancer. perhaps, i need to have two vms
    one for displaying the website and one for hosting the file. 
        given this, what changes should i make to my current config?

i should ask gpt for advice. using a "two tier" architecture or using the jump-off box?
    i do want to make sure i'm using load balancer for web and app (possibly what might be file hosting)
        so i also can use vmss (for when many are accessing my website and files there)

at the end, make sure to use concepts like

instead of using the database config, use some ansible config instead for the vmss. or docker?
